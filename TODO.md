# TODO

- Amount to dispense in MTP and PRE?
- Documents: remove link?
- In PML entries, where to store document ID?
- Fulfillment instructions
- Full datetimes where it's important
- Contained resources in PML/PMLC

## Questions

- When are contained resources allowed? E.g. Medication in MedicationStatement, but not resources in composition?
- id vs identifier? Which usage?
