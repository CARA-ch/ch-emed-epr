# TODO

- Amount to dispense in MPT and PRE?
- Documents: remove link?
- Ref(Patient): in Document, Composition, MedicationStatement/Request/Observation?
- Replace Practition/PractitionerRole with our definitions

## Questions

- When are contained resources allowed? E.g. Medication in MedicationStatement, but not resources in composition?
- Can we add FHIR/FSH flag?
- id vs identifier? Which usage?
